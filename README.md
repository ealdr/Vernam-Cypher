# **The Vernam Cypher (One-Time Pad Encryption)**

### **How it works**
1. The user inputs a plaintext message
2. Each character is converted to ASCII
3. A one-time pad (a random byte per character) is generated
4. The message and pad are XORed
5. The encrypted output is displayed in hexadecimal



### **NOTE**
This uses python's random module which is not cryptographically secure



### **How to run**
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed
2. Clone this repository or download the file
3. Run the script from the terminal or your code editor
4. Enter text message
